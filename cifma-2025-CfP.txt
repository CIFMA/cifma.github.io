International Workshop on Cognition: Interdisciplinary Foundations, Models and Applications
11 November 2025, Toledo, Spain (Co-located with SEFM 2025)
Background and Objectives
Cognition encompasses a wide range of intellectual functions and processes such as attention, memory, reasoning, problem solving, decision making, and language comprehension and production. Although rooted in psychology, the study of cognition now spans a wide array of disciplines, driven by the increasing complexity of human interaction with technological systems, virtual environments, and intelligent machines.
 
CIFMA 2025 (https://cifma.github.io/) aims to provide a collaborative forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and research institutions who are interested in the foundations and applications of cognition. The workshop encourages interdisciplinary dialogue and concrete collaborations between fields such as computer science, logic, neuroscience, linguistics, cognitive robotics, philosophy, and more.
The workshop specifically promotes the use of formal methods as a unifying approach to model and analyze cognitive systems and processes, extending well beyond their traditional use in software engineering.
Contributions to the workshop cover the areas of education, research and technology, either in general or with a focus on formal methods. Topics are organized in possibly overlapping categories and include, but are not restricted to:
 
Interdisciplinary Foundations of Cognition:
philosophy of cognition
human memory and memory processes
attention
perception, visual cognition and situated cognition

cognitive approaches to grammar
cognitive and conceptual semantics
cognitive phonology
dynamical models of language acquisition
computational models of metaphor and language acquisition
corpus linguistics and conversational data
Cognitive Learning:
learning theories

Important Dates
Paper Submission Deadline: Wednesday, 3 September 2025
Notification of Acceptance: Wednesday, 15 October 2025
Pre-proceedings Final Version Due: Monday, 3 November 2025
Post-proceedings Final Version (LNCS): TBA
Proceedings and Publication
Accepted full and short papers will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer.
