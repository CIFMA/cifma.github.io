===================================================================================
2nd International Workshop on Cognition: 
Interdisciplinary Foundations, Models and Applications

Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 14 September 2020

https://cifma.github.io

Co-located with SEFM 2020
===================================================================================

CIFMA 2020 WILL BE AN ENTIRELY VIRTUAL EVENT

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, following the decision taken by the
SEFM 2020 organisers, also CIFMA 2020 will not take place physically
but will be replaced by a virtual event.
As usual, CIFMA 2020 accepted contributions will be included in the
LNCS post-proceedings and all accepted papers will have to be presented
at the virtual conference in order to be included in the LNCS volume.
How the virtual conference will be organised is still under consideration,
e.g., live presentations and/or recorded ones.

Cognition encompasses many aspects of intellectual functions and processes such as
attention, knowledge, memory, judgment, reasoning, problem solving, decision making,
comprehension and production of language. Although it originated from the field of
psychology, it goes beyond the individual human mind and behaviour, and involves
and affects the interaction with the environment in which humans act.
The increasing complexity of the environment with which humans interact is no longer
restricted to their natural living environment and the other humans populating it,
but includes a large technological support consisting of physical and computational
systems, virtual worlds and robots. This fact has expanded the scope of studying
cognition to a large number of disciplines well beyond psychology.
Cognitive processes are analysed from different perspectives within different
contexts, notably in the fields of linguistics, anesthesia, neuroscience, psychiatry,
psychology, education, philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, biology, systemics,
logic, and computer science. These and other different approaches to the analysis
of cognition are synthesised in the developing field of cognitive science, a
progressively autonomous academic discipline.

The objectives of this new international workshop are:

1. to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia, industry and
   research institutions who are interested in the foundations and applications of
   cognition from the perspective of their areas of expertise and aim at a
   synergistic effort in integrating approaches from different areas;
2. to nurture cooperation among researchers from different areas and establish
   concrete collaborations;
3. to present formal methods to cognitive scientists as a general modelling and
   analysis approach, whose effectiveness goes well beyond its application to
   computer science and software engineering.

KEYNOTE SPEAKER

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authors are invited to submit, via Easychair, research contributions or experience
reports. The submission link is: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cifma2020

All papers should be written in English and prepared using the specific LNCS
templates available at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.
Submissions are required to report on original, unpublished work and should not be
submitted simultaneously for publication elsewhere.

There are six categories of submissions

* Research papers:
  to present original research and the analysis, interpretation and validation of
  the research findings.

* Position papers:
  to present innovative, arguable ideas, opinions or frameworks which are likely
  to foster discussion at the workshop.

* Interdisciplinary Project papers:
  To describe a new interdisciplinary research project, or the status of an ongoing
  project or the outcomes of a recently completed project.

* Case Study papers:
  to report on case studies, preferably in a real-world setting.

* Tool papers:
  to present a new tool, a new tool component or novel extensions to an existing tool.

* Tool Demonstration papers:
  to demonstrate the tool workflow(s) and human interaction aspects, and evaluate
  the overall role of the tool and impact on cognitive science.

Contributions will be in the form of

- Regular papers:
  between 12 and 15 pages for submission
  (and between 12 and 16 pages for post-proceedings camera-ready).

- Short papers:
  between 6 and 8 pages for submission
  (and between 6 and 9 pages for post-proceedings camera-ready).

- Presentations:
  extended abstract up to 4 pages, which will be included in the pre-proceeding
  but not published in the post-proceedings.

"Short papers" and "Presentations" can discuss new ideas which are at an early
stage of development and which have not yet been thoroughly evaluated.

The program committee may reject papers that are outside these lengths on the
grounds of length alone.

Submitted papers will be refereed for quality, correctness, originality and
relevance. Notification and reviews will be communicated via email. Accepted
papers (both Full papers and Short papers) will be included in the workshop
programme and will appear in the workshop pre-proceedings as well as in the
LNCS post-proceedings. Pre-proceedings will be available online before the
Workshop.
