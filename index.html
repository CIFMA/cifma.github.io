                      <p class="text">Cognition encompasses many aspects of intellectual functions and processes such as
                        attention, knowledge, memory, judgment, reasoning, problem solving, decision making, comprehension
                        and production of language.
                        Although it originated from the field of psychology, it goes beyond the individual human mind and
                        behaviour, and involves and affects the interaction with the environment in which humans act.
                        The increasing complexity of the environment with which humans interact, which is no longer restricted
                        to their natural living environment and the other humans populating it, but includes a large
                        technological support consisting of physical and computational systems, virtual worlds and robots,
                        has expanded the scope of studying cognition to a large number of disciplines well beyond psychology.
                        Cognitive processes are analysed from different perspectives within different contexts, notably in
                        the fields of linguistics, anesthesia, neuroscience, psychiatry, psychology, education, philosophy,
                        anthropology, linguistics, biology, systemics, logic, and computer science.
                        These and other different approaches to the analysis of cognition are synthesised in the developing
                        field of cognitive science, a progressively autonomous academic discipline.</p>
                     <p class="text">The objectives of this new international workshop are:
                        <ol class="text">

                            perspective of their areas of expertise and aim at a synergistic effort in integrating
                            approaches from different areas;</li>
                          <li>to nurture cooperation among researchers from different areas and establish concrete

                            approach, whose effectiveness goes well beyond its application to computer science and software

Final decisions about acceptance/rejection of papers will be made through a closed discussion among the PC members.
Notification and reviews will be communicated via email.
Accepted papers will be included in the workshop programme and will appear
