6th International Workshop on Cognition: Interdisciplinary Foundations, Models and Applications

5 November 2024, Aveiro, Portugal

Co-located with SEFM 2024

Website: https://cifma.github.io/


=== IMPORTANT DATES ===
Paper Submission deadline: Saturday 14 September, 2024 (AoE)
Notification: Saturday 12 October, 2024


=== BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES ===

Cognition encompasses many aspects of intellectual functions and processes such as attention, knowledge, memory, judgment, reasoning, problem solving, decision making, comprehension and production of language. Although it originated from the field of psychology, it goes beyond the individual human mind and behaviour, and involves and affects the interaction with the environment in which humans act. The increasing complexity of the environment with which humans interact is no longer restricted to their natural living environment and the other humans populating it, but includes a large technological support consisting of physical and computational systems, virtual worlds and robots. This fact has expanded the scope of studying cognition to a large number of disciplines well beyond psychology. Cognitive processes are analysed from different perspectives within different contexts, notably in the fields of linguistics, neuroscience, psychiatry, psychology, education, philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, biology, systemics, logic, and computer science. These and other different approaches to the analysis of cognition are synthesised in the developing field of cognitive science, a progressively autonomous academic discipline.

The objectives of CIFMA are:
(1) to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia, industry and research institutions who are interested in the foundations and applications of cognition from the perspective of their areas of expertise and aim at a synergistic effort in integrating approaches from different areas;
(2) to nurture cooperation among researchers from different areas and establish concrete collaborations;
(3) to present formal methods to cognitive scientists as a general modelling and analysis approach, whose effectiveness goes well beyond its application to computer science and software engineering.

Cognitive Linguistics:
- cognitive approaches to grammar
- cognitive and conceptual semantics
- conceptual organisation
- cognitive phonology
- dynamical models of language acquisition
- computational models of metaphor and language acquisition

Cognitive Learning:

=== SUBMISSION ===

Link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cifma2024

Authors are invited to submit, via Easychair, research contributions or experience reports.

All papers should be written in English and prepared using the specific LNCS templates available at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html. Submissions are required to report on original, unpublished work and should not be submitted simultaneously for publication elsewhere (cf. IFIP's Author Code of Conduct)

There are six categories of submissions:
- Research papers, to present original research and the analysis, interpretation and validation of the research findings.
- Position papers, to present innovative, arguable ideas, opinions or frameworks which are likely to foster discussion at the workshop.
- Interdisciplinary Project papers, to describe a new interdisciplinary research project, or the status of an ongoing project or the outcomes of a recently completed project.
- Case Study papers, to report on case studies, preferably in a real-world setting.
- Tool papers, to present a new tool, a new tool component or novel extensions to an existing tool.
- Tool Demonstration papers, to demonstrate the tool workflow(s) and human interaction aspects, and evaluate the overall role of the tool and impact on cognitive science.
- Progress paper, to discuss the progress status of works presented at previous editions of CIFMA. 

Please make sure you write the paper category (Research paper, Position paper, Interdisciplinary Project paper, Case Study paper, Tool paper, Tool Demonstration paper, Progress paper) somewhere in the abstract on Easychair (e.g. "This Research paper ...").

Contributions will be in the form of
- Regular papers, between 12 and 15 pages except references for submission (and between 12 and 17 pages except references for post-proceedings camera-ready).
- Short papers, between 6 and 8 pages except references for submission (and between 6 and 9 pages except references for post-proceedings camera-ready).
- Presentations, extended abstract up to 4 pages, which will be included in the pre-proceeding but not published in the post-proceedings.

"Short papers" and "Presentations" may discuss new ideas which are at an early stage of development and which have not yet been thoroughly evaluated. The program committee may reject papers that are outside these lengths on the grounds of length alone.

Submitted papers will be refereed for quality, correctness, originality and relevance. Notification and reviews will be communicated via email. Accepted papers (both Full papers and Short papers) will be included in the workshop programme and will appear in the workshop pre-proceedings as well as in the LNCS post-proceedings. Pre-proceedings will be available online before the Workshop. The authors of accepted Short papers may opt to extend their contributions to Regular paper to be published in the LNCS post-proceedings by going through a second review phase after the workshop.


=== PUBLICATION ===

Accepted regular and short papers will be published after the Workshop by Springer in a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (http://www.springer.com/lncs). Condition for inclusion in the post-proceedings is that at least one of the co-authors has presented the paper at the Workshop.

A journal special issue(s) with selected papers may be planned, depending on the number and quality of the submissions. 


=== PROGRAM CO-CHAIR ===

Graham Pluck, Faculty of Psychology, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand.
